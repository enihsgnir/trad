# Trad

## Overview

**Trad** stands for **Tiny Rightmost-derivation Analyzer for Dart**. It’s also "**Dart**" spelled in reverse — a fitting name for a project that analyzes Dart syntax from the ground up.

This project is an experimental implementation of a Dart compiler and runtime environment, written entirely in Dart. It explores core language processing, parsing, and execution techniques while relying only on minimal dependencies within the Dart ecosystem.

## Goals

- Parse Dart source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Perform basic static analysis and type resolution
- Compile to an intermediate representation (IR)
- Interpret or execute the IR at runtime

## Project Structure

Coming soon — will outline the internal architecture of the project.

## Getting Started

Instructions for running and experimenting with `trad` will be provided as the project evolves.

## Status

This project is in early development and not yet capable of compiling full Dart programs. Contributions and discussions are welcome.
